    1. Clone the repository into your local machine by running git clone https://github.com/claudiaalmeidavs/nimbus-note-backend.git
    2. Navigate to the project directory by entering the command "cd your-project-folder"
    3. Run "npm install" in the project directory to install all the necessary packages and dependencies.
    4. Create a .env file based on the provided .env.sample file. Complete the necessary environment variables in the .env file, such as database credentials and app port.
    5. Run "npm run migrate" to create or reset the database required for Nimbus Note to run dynamically.

## Technologies used

The server for Nimbus Note is developed using the following technologies:

    1. JavaScript: The programming language used for both frontend and backend development in Nimbus Note.
    2. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It runs the backend server for Nimbus Note.
    3. Express: Express handles routing, middleware, and request handling for the Nimbus Note server.
    4. SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) is used for managing and manipulating relational databases, allowing data creation, modification, and retrieval.
    5. MySQL: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. MySQL is utilized as the database for storing and retrieving project data in Nimbus Note.
